        <h5>4. How we protect and store the personal data which we hold</h5>

        <p>We use administrative, technical and physical measures to keep your personal data confidential and secure, in accordance with our internal procedures to protect it from being accidentally lost, altered, used, accessed or disclosed in an unauthorised way.&nbsp;Personal data may be held on our data technology systems, those of our third-party contractors and/or in paper files.&nbsp;Where we share information with third parties, we will obtain written confirmation that they will similarly protect the data with appropriate safeguards.</p>

        <p>Although we do our best to ensure the security of your personal data and to use only reputable service providers, unfortunately no information system can be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. In particular, we will not be responsible for the security of any information which you transmit to us over networks that we do not control including the internet and wireless networks.&nbsp;We have in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>If you follow any link from our website to a third-party website or deal with any third party entity referred to on the website, you should be aware that third parties will have their own privacy terms and that we are not responsible for their use of any personal data which you share with them and you should ensure that you have read and understood the policies of that third party.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>5. When we may transfer your personal data abroad</h5>

        <p>As Hausfeld operates globally, we may transfer your personal data abroad for storage or processing where required for any of the purposes set out above, including any of the countries in which Hausfeld and its affiliates, agents or contractors have offices.&nbsp;When doing so, we will comply with applicable data protection requirements and take appropriate safeguards to ensure the security and integrity of your personal data.&nbsp;Where we use third party service providers, we will put in place confidentiality agreements, including appropriate data protection obligations.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>For users of this website who are based in the UK or the European Economic Area (&ldquo;UK/EEA&rdquo;), you should be aware that information which you provide to Hausfeld may be transferred to countries outside of the UK/EEA (including the United States) which do not always have the same standard of data protection as those inside the UK/EEA.&nbsp;For the purposes of processing your data, we will ensure a data protection level equivalent to the minimum level within the UK/EEA including entering into the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or by other similar protective measures.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>6. How long we will retain personal data</h5>

        <p>Any personal data will be deleted when it is no longer reasonably required for the permitted purposes for which it is held or you withdraw your consent (where applicable) and we are not legally required or otherwise permitted to continuing storing the data.&nbsp;Where necessary, we will retain your personal data where it may be required for Hausfeld to assert or defend any legal claims or otherwise asserts its rights or those of third parties until the end of the relevant retention period or until any claims have been resolved.&nbsp;We will also retain personal data where necessary to comply with our legal obligations, regulatory requirements and reporting obligations. We may also hold data in backup systems which are put in place to maintain the integrity of our IT systems for the minimum retention periods.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <li>to ask us to update or correct any personal information which we hold, object to or ask us to restrict the processing of that personal data for particular purposes.&nbsp;You may object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes and withdraw any consent you have previously given to us at any stage by notifying us by email to dataprivacy@hausfeld.com or using the other contact details below.&nbsp;Where you object to the data being processed for other purposes, we will not do so unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms, including compliance with legal obligations and for the purposes of legal claims;</li>
          <li>where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, you may have the right to request that it be erased but this may be overridden where the data is necessary for other purposes including compliance with a legal obligation or in connection with potential legal claims;</li>
          <li>where we hold personal data with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you and processing is carried out by automated means, you may have the right to receive your personal data from us in a commonly used format so that it can be transferred to an alternative third-party provider, provided it would not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others; &nbsp;</li>
