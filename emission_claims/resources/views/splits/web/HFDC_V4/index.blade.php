                                        <p><b>This note sets out a summary for claimants who wish to participate in the group claim against Mercedes represented by Hausfeld and using litigation funding provided by CF BH Ltd, an entity serviced by Black Hammer Capital.</b> </p>

                                        <p>Your claim against Mercedes will be run as part of a group, alongside other claimantsâ claims. The claimants have formed a committee to make key decisions in relation to the claims on behalf of the claimant group, including giving instructions to us, Hausfeld, as your lawyers, regarding the running of the claims and any decision on settlement.</p>
                                        <p>The costs of bringing the claims will be paid on your behalf by the litigation funder, who will also take out adverse costs insurance to cover the risks of having to pay the defendantâs costs if the claim does not succeed. In return, the litigation funder is entitled to 40% of your compensation at the end of the case (which will include your liability for our fees and other costs), plus any unrecovered VAT payable on Hausfeldâs conditional fees, which we refer to below as the âFunding Feeâ. If you win your claim, you will keep 60% of your compensation less any unrecovered VAT payable on Hausfeldâs conditional fees.</p>
                                        <p>To become a claimant, you must read and sign four legally binding agreements: (i) two engagements with your lawyers, Hausfeld; (ii) a litigation management agreement, which sets out how your claim and other claimantsâ claims will be run together; and (iii) a funding participation agreement which says that you understand and agree to adhere to the terms of the funding agreement and the Priorities Agreement. <u> This summary is not a substitute for reading the agreements in detail but it is intended to help you understand what these agreements say.</u> </p>
                                        <p><b>1. YOUR LAWYERS - THE HAUSFELD ENGAGEMENTS</b> </p>
                                        <p>In conjunction with your agreement to the funding agreement, Hausfeld will work for you on the basis that if you donât win your claim, no fee is required from you. The terms on which Hausfeld are engaged are contained in Hausfeldâs two engagement letters: the first engagement applies when Hausfeldâs fees are being paid in part by the funder; the second engagement will apply when the budget for Hausfeldâs fees under the Funding Agreement has been used up and Hausfeldâs fees are no longer being part-paid by the funder.</p>
                                        <p>Under the first engagement, 55% of Hausfeldâs fees and other litigation costs will be paid by the funder on your behalf, as the litigation progresses. The remaining 45% of Hausfeldâs fees are deferred and will only be due if you win your case, together with a success fee which is the equivalent of 45% of Hausfeldâs fees. Under the second engagement, Hausfeld will work for you with no payment at all unless the claim is successful. On success, the full fees will be payable together with a success fee which is equivalent of 100% of Hausfeldâs fees. You will be notified by the committee at the point at which the budget has been used up and Hausfeldâs second engagement starts to apply.</p>
                                        <p>If you win your case, Hausfeld will recover all or part of your legal fees, including the deferred fees to the extent possible, from Mercedes and these will be paid to Hausfeld, alongside their success fee, from the Funding Fee, which you agree to pay to the funder. Your liability in respect of Hausfeldâs fees and disbursements in the event that your claim is successful is as set out in the Hausfeld engagements. It is capped within the Funding Fee, so that you will receive 60% of the Damages Award (less any unrecovered VAT on Hausfeldâs conditional fees). If you lose your case, you will not have to pay any legal fees provided you have complied with your obligations under the agreements.</p>
                                        <p>The committee will instruct Hausfeld, on your behalf. Invoices for Hausfeldâs non-deferred fees and other litigation costs will be sent to the committee and the committee will be able to approve these on your behalf. In instructing Hausfeld, you agree that you will provide your lawyers with accurate and complete</p>
                                        <p>information about your claim, in a timely manner. Hausfeld will advise you as part of the group of claimants and will only be able to progress your claim once you have completed the registration process and information questionnaire in full. Hausfeld does not have to proceed with your claim if it isnât appropriate to do so, for example because it does not have sufficient prospects of success, or if it is not suitable to be pursued as part of the group claim (for example due to needing to be issued before the rest of the group or where it might involve different parties which are not common to other claimants) â if this is the case, Hausfeld will inform you as soon as possible. As part of the agreement with the litigation funder, your claim will not be filed until the minimum group size of 27,500 claimants has been met and the funder has put in place the insurance policy to cover adverse costs.</p>
                                        <p>You can cancel your retainer with Hausfeld any time within 14 days of agreeing to the engagement terms. Outside of that 14 day period, you can cancel your retainer at any time but if you do so without Hausfeldâs written permission then you may be charged Hausfeldâs costs, as set out in the engagement letter and any costs incurred on your behalf by the funder as set out below. Hausfeld has the right to cancel their engagement with you if they have a good reason to do so, such as because you have failed to provide all the information required about your claim, and in this scenario you may be charged Hausfeldâs costs insofar as they relate to your claim.</p>
                                        <p><b><u>II RUNNING THE CLAIMS AS A GROUP â THE LITIGATON MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT</u></b> </p>
                                        <P>It would only be viable to bring your claim against Mercedes as part of a group of other claims, given the costs involved in litigation and the efficiencies created by grouping the claims together. It is in your best interests to cooperate with the other claimants represented by Hausfeld. It is also, in Hausfeldâs view, in your best interests to cooperate with a further group of claimants, whose claims are materially similar to the Hausfeld groupâs claims and are being run by another law firm, Harcus Parker. Cooperation with the Harcus Parker claimants maximises the efficiencies and other benefits of bringing the claims as a group.</P>
                                        <P>In order for multiple claimantsâ claims to be brought as a group, an agreement is needed between claimants as to how to run the claim â this document in the litigation management agreement. This agreement also, sets out how the committee will run your claim on your behalf, how the costs of running the litigation will be shared, governs the co-operation with the Harcus Parker claimants, how decisions on settlement of the claim will be made by the Committee and how the compensation will be divided between claimants in the event of a successful judgment or settlement.</P>
                                        <P>The costs of running the litigation will be met by the litigation funder and recovered from Mercedes if the claims are successful. A high proportion of those costs are expected to be common to all of the claims, including the Harcus Parker claimants. However, some costs may be specific to an issue which affects certain claimants or individual to certain claimants. Your allocation of the costs of bringing the claim will be calculated based on the number of vehicles which you have in the claim, as set out in more detail in the litigation management agreement. These costs will be paid on your behalf and recovered from the defendant and you will only have to pay the Funding Fee provided you do not breach any terms of the agreements.</P>
                                        <P>If damages are obtained via a successful judgment or settlement, the Committee will decide, following the advice of counsel how best to divide up those damages between the claimants. The claimants agree not to accept any settlement offer from Mercedes that does not account for the costs of running the litigation and if any such offer is made and accepted then you will be liable to Hausfeld and to the litigation funder for your costs.</P>
                                        <P>As with Hausfeldâs engagement, you can terminate your participation in the litigation management agreement within 14 days agreeing to its terms. Outside of this 14 day period, you may only terminate your involvement with the permission of the litigation funder and the insurer and if you do so then you may be liable for your share of the litigation costs. If you do not cooperate with reasonable requests from Hausfeld or the litigation funder during the claim, the committee may discontinue your claim and terminate your</P>
                                        <P>participation in the litigation management agreement. Hausfeld will no longer be able to represent you in relation to your claim and the Hausfeld engagement will also be terminated. If your participation in the litigation management agreement ends, your engagement with Hausfeld will be terminated and vice versa.</P>
                                        <P><u><b>lll. THE COSTS OF THE CLAIMS â THE FUNDING PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT</b></u> </P>
                                        <p>The Funding Agreement has been agreed with the Funder by the Chair of the Claimant Committee and in entering into the Funding Participation Agreement, you confirm your agreement to the terms of the Funding Agreement and to the Priorities Agreement.</p>
                                        <p>The Funding Agreement sets out the terms on which the Funder will advance the costs of the litigation on your behalf in accordance with the agreed budget and your agreement to pay the Funding Fee (being 40% of your damages and any unrecovered VAT on our Conditional Fees) if the claims are successful. â¢The Priorities Agreement explains how the claim proceeds will be allocated which sets out the payment to you of the agreed 60% of your damages aware less any unrecovered VAT on our conditional fees.</p>
                                        <p>The Funding Agreement provides that the projected costs of running the claims of Â£10,302,553 will be paid on your behalf by the litigation funder. This includes any non- deferred fees paid under the Hausfeld Engagements together with any anticipated disbursement costs and the costs of the insurance, which will cover the Hausfeld and the Harcus Parker claimants against the risk of having to pay Mercedesâ costs. The level of funding available under the funding agreement can be increased during the course of the proceedings by agreement between the committee and the funder if we believe it is reasonably necessary to conclude the claims.</p>
                                        <p>The funding agreement also provides protection to the claimants in the event that their claims are lost. Usually in litigation, the losing party is ordered to pay the winning sideâs legal costs â however, in this case, the litigation funder has indemnified you against paying Mercedesâ costs up to Â£7.5 million on the terms of an insurance policy which it will take out. If you do not agree with the terms of the insurance which the funder obtains, including as to the level of indemnity provided under the insurance, then you will have 14 days from the terms of the insurance being made available to you to cancel your participation in the claims.</p>
                                        <p>There may be some circumstances in which adverse costs will not be covered by the insurance policy, for example where the funder believes it is not viable to continue running the claim and the insurer does not to agree to the claims being discontinued. It is also possible that the insurance may be inadequate in some respect, including due to the level of cover, insurer insolvency or the risk of avoidance, which may result in exposure to adverse costs. However, we believe the risk of these eventualities is low and in this case any liability for adverse costs would be split between all claimants by reference to the number of vehicles for which they claim such that each claimant is only liable for a share.</p>
                                        <p>If the claim is successful, in return for the Funderâs commitment to the claims, you agree to pay the funder the Funding Fee. The Funding Fee comprises 40% of your damages, plus any unrecovered VAT on the portion of legal fees which are contingent upon success, and 100% of all costs which are recovered from the defendants. You will retain 60% of the damages received less any unrecovered VAT on the portion of legal fees which are contingent upon success. The Funding Fee will be used to pay the funder, Hausfeld and counsel their conditional fees, the insurer and the US Consortium.</p>
                                        <p>As part of the agreement with the litigation funder, your claim will not be filed until the minimum group size of 27,500 claimants has been met and the funder has put in place the insurance.</p>
                                        <p>Obligations and warranties: As part of signing up to the action, you agree, via the Funding Participation Agreement, that you will adhere to the terms of the funding agreement. The claimants have obligations under the funding agreement, in particular:</p>
                                        <p>that the information provided to Hausfeld about your claim must be true and accurate and that there is nothing of relevance of which you are aware about your claim which you have failed to disclose to Hausfeld. If any further information about your claim comes to light then you will disclose this to Hausfeld. You also agree that all information which you provide can be shared with the Funder;</p>
                                        <p>that you have had the opportunity to take independent legal advice in relation to your participation in the claims; â¢that you will comply with the terms of the funderâs insurance once this is put in place, a copy of the terms of which will be made available to you. You will also comply with any steps required by the funder to procure, maintain or claim under the insurance and you will not take any steps which may jeopardise the insurance; â¢that you will follow the legal advice of Hausfeld and counsel and cooperate with them throughout the proceedings so as to maximise the chances of a successful outcome and minimise any exposure to having to pay the defendantsâ costs; â¢that you agree that if you do not comply with your obligations under the Funding Agreement or if any of the warranties that you have provided are untrue, you may be in breach of the Funding Agreement and liable to pay the Funder your share of the costs the Funder has invested in the claims. You may also share liability for any breach by the claimant committee; and â¢to follow legal advice and to abide by the terms of the funderâs insurance, and it is important that you follow these obligations and comply with any requests from Hausfeld or the Committee or else you may be in breach of the funding agreement.</p>
                                        <p>Termination: The funder can terminate your participation in the funding agreement if you breach its terms or fail to co-operate with any request from Hausfeld or the Committee to progress the claims where requested to do so. In this scenario you will be liable to pay the Funder your share of the costs the Funder has invested in the claims. The funder may also terminate its funding of the claims if the size of the claimant group does not reach the target of 43,200 claimants, if the claims become commercially unviable or the prospects of success drop below a certain level and/or the Funder cannot obtain the insurance on terms which align with the Priorities Agreement. If the claims have been filed and the funder stops funding the claims because the claimant targets are not met, the funder will cover any exposure you have to Mercedes for paying Mercedesâ costs. However, if the funder stops funding the claims for any other reason and the insurer does not approve of the discontinuance of the claims, you may be exposed to paying to Mercedes your share of their costs. If you wish to withdraw from the claim, you can only do so with the agreement of the Funder and you will be liable to pay the Funder your share of the costs the Funder has invested in the claim.</p>
                                        <p>Under the Litigation Management Agreement, you agree that the Committee has the authority to amend the Funding Agreement and the Priorities Agreement including any increase to the budget, but it may only agree to change the amount of the Funding Fee in circumstances in which it is not otherwise be possible to put in place the insurance and is considered by the Claimant Committee in the claimantsâ best interests in order to progress the claims. You understand that if the Committee proposes to change the amount of the Funding Fee, you will have the right within 14 days of notice to elect to cancel your participation in the Funding Agreement, the Priorities Agreement and the claims.</p>
                                        <p>THIS IS ONLY A SUMMARY: it is not a substitute for reading the agreements in full. You must now read each agreement and sign to say that you agree with its terms. You may wish to take independent legal advice on the agreements before entering into them. As set out in the agreements, if you are signing up as a consumer rather than a business then you have a right to cancel your participation in the agreements within 14 days by sending written notice to <a href="#">MercedesEmissionsClaim@hausfeld.com </a>.</p>

This is based on a total figure of Â£10,302,553, comprising approximately Â£2.1 million (including VAT) of our Discounted Fees, counsel fees of Â£2.9 million (representing 80% of senior and junior counselâs fees as 20% of counselâs fees are deferred and payable only if the action is successful, plus costs counselâs fees), Insurance costs of Â£1.04 million (including Insurance Premium Tax) and approximately Â£4.26 million of other Disbursement Costs.

                                        <p class="p52 ft3">11.1 In the High Court and Court of Appeal, the normal rule in English proceedings is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party, such costs being Adverse Costs.</p>

The Funding Agreement specifies that Claimants have an obligation to the Funder to comply with any obligations imposed on them by the Insurance.</p>
                                        <p class="p118 ft3">11.3 As the Claimants would ordinarily, as a matter of law, be jointly and severally liable for Adverse Costs:</p>

Each Claimantâs several liability for Adverse Costs shall be calculated using the mechanism for calculating the Proportionate Share for liability also for the Adverse Costs, calculated in accordance with Clause 9.2 a) and/or b) (as may be the case) above or the HP Proportionate Share in accordance with Clause 10.3 to the extent common to the Claimants and the HP Claimants.</p>
                                        <p class="p113 ft20">11.4 The Claimants also acknowledge that the Adverse Costs Cover may be based on a cross- subsidy between the Claimants and the HP Claimants, and thereby across Claims which have different bases. The effect of this may be that if the Claims of some Claimants succeed and some fail, there may be a liability to pay the Adverse Costs of those that fail but which will be taken from the successful Claimantsâ 60% share of their recovery which is paid pursuant to the terms of the Funding Agreement. This provision may be necessary in order to secure insurance to cover this type of group claim and protect Claimants against the risk of adverse costs. If it does not prove possible in due course for the Funder to secure Insurance for the Adverse Costs Cover which: (i) would be capped within the 60% share of the Claimantsâ recovery in the event that some of the Claims did not succeed; and/or (ii) keeps each Claimantâs liability for Adverse Costs several, the Claimants will be notified of any required change to the Funding Agreement and provided with the right (pursuant to Clause 10.3 of the Funding Agreement) within 14 days of notification to terminate its participation in the Claims, the Funding Agreement the Hausfeld Engagements, with no adverse costs consequences for a Claimant who terminates on this basis.</p>
                                        <p class="p53 ft20">11.5 The Claimants agree that Hausfeld should, if it thinks it necessary, apply to the court for an order reflecting the provisions of this Clause 11. In the event that no such order is made, the Claimants each accept that with the exception of any amount paid under the Funding Fee, any Claimant who is burdened with a greater share than their Proportionate Share within each Claim they pursue should be entitled to recover the difference from their fellow Claimants within that Claim: any Claimant who has initially borne a greater burden of such liabilities shall have a right of recovery which the Claimants agree will not be contested against any of his or her fellow Claimants who have not paid their due share.</p>
                                        <p class="p51 ft1">11.6 Nothing in this Agreement shall make the Committee or any member of it liable for Adverse Costs save to the extent that any such member faces a liability in respect of his or her capacity as a Claimant.</p>

The Claimants further recognise and agree that it may be appropriate for certain categories of Claimants to settle and not others and to consider, in the event of a group offer, how damages should be allocated between different categories of Claimant.</p>

                                        <p class="p125 ft8">b) The Claims are conducted subject to agreements between the Claimants which contain an agreement to work together which provides that if there is a settlement before trial, it will not be necessary to take account of the individual issues of each Claimantâs case if it would be expensive and burdensome to do so.</p>
                                        <p class="p126 ft1">c) At the outset of the Claims, it was not clear what factors would be relevant to the distribution of global damages.</p>
                                        <p class="p57 ft1">d) One of the issues to be decided, as to which the adjudicator has complete discretion, is likely to be whether each Claimant who is able to prove his or her entitlement to a share of the Overall Claim Proceeds due to the Claimants pursuant to the terms of the Funding Agreement and the Priorities Agreement should receive the same amount or whether they should receive a payment which reflects other factors, and if so what factors.</p>
                                        <p class="p110 ft1">e) In reaching his or her determination, the adjudicator is asked to bear in mind the principles underlying this Agreement and the additional cost and complexity that may flow from distinguishing between different groups of Claimants.</p>

Mercedesâ parent company, Daimler, was fined â¬870 million by German prosecutors in 2019 relating to the emissions scandal and Mercedes vehicles have been subject to recalls, including in the UK.

          <h6>MERCEDES EMISSIONS CLAIMS â  SUMMARY OF FUNDING AND ENGAGEMENT DOCUMENT</h6>
          <p><b>
            This note sets out a summary for claimants who wish to participate in the group claim against Mercedes represented by Hausfeld and using litigation funding provided by CF BH Ltd, an entity serviced by Black Hammer Capital.
          </b></p>
          <p>Your claim against Mercedes will be run as part of a group, alongside other claimantsâ claims. The claimants have formed a committee to make key decisions in relation to the claims on behalf of the claimant group, including giving instructions to us, Hausfeld, as your lawyers, regarding the running of the claims and any decision on settlement.</p>
          <p>The costs of bringing the claims will be paid on your behalf by the   litigation funder, who will also take out adverse costs insurance to cover the risks of having to pay the defendantâs costs if the claim does not succeed. In return, the litigation funder is entitled to 40% of your compensation at the end of the case (which will include your liability for our fees and other costs), plus any unrecovered VAT payable on Hausfeldâs conditional fees, whic   h we refer to below as the âFunding Feeâ. If you win your claim, you will keep 60% of your compensation less any unrecovered VAT payable on Hausfeldâs conditional fees.</p>
          <p>To become a claimant, you must read and sign four legally binding agreements: (i) two engagements with your lawyers, Hausfeld; (ii) a litigation management agreement, which sets out how your claim and other claimantsâ claims will be run together; and (iii) a funding participation agreement which says that you understand and agree to adhere to the terms of the funding agreement and the Priorities Agreement. <u> This    summary is not a substitute  for    reading  the    agreements  in  detail  but  it  is  intended to  help you    understand what     theseagreements say.</u></p>
          <p> <b>l. YOUR LAWYERS -  THE HAUSFELD ENGAGEMENTS</b></p>
          <p>In conjunction with your agreement to the funding agreement, Hausfeld will work for you on the basis that if you donât win your claim, no fee is required from you. The terms on which Hausfeld are engaged are contained in Hausfeldâs two engagement letters: the first engagement applies when Hausfeldâs fees are being paid in part by the funder; the second engagement will apply when the budget for Hausfeldâs fees under the Funding Agreement has been used up and Hausfeldâs fees are no longer being part- paid by the funde</p>
          <p>Under the first engagement, 55% of Hausfeldâs fees and other litigation costs will be paid by the funder on your behalf, as the litigation progresses. The remaining 45% of Hausfeldâs fees are deferred and will only be due if you win your case, together with a success fee which is the equivalent of 45% of Hausfeldâs fees. Under the second engagement, Hausfeld will work for you with no payment at all unless the claim is successful. On success, the full fees will be payable together with a success fee which is equivalent of 100% of Hausfeldâs fees. You will be notified by the committee at the point at which the budget has been used up and Hausfeldâs second engagement starts to apply.</p>
          <p>If you win your case, Hausfeld will recover all or part of your legal fees, including the deferred fees to the extent possible, from Mercedes and these will be paid to Hausfeld, alongside their success fee, from the Funding Fee, which you agree to pay to the funder. Your liability in respect of Hausfeldâs fees and disbursements in the event that your claim is successful is as set out in the Hausfeld engagements. It is capped within the Funding Fee, so that you will receive 60% of the Damages Award (less any unrecovered VAT on Hausfeldâs conditional fees). If you lose your case, you will not have to pay any legal fees provided you have complied with your obligations under the agreements.</p>
          <p>The committee will instruct Hausfeld, on your behalf. Invoices for Hausfeldâs non-deferred fees and other litigation costs will be sent to the committee and the committee will be able to approve these on your behalf. In instructing Hausfeld, you agree that you will provide your lawyers with accurate and complete information about your claim, in a timely manner. Hausfeld will advise you as part of the group of claimants and will only be  able  to  progress  your  claim  once  you  have  completed  the  registration  process  and  information questionnaire in full. Hausfeld does not have to proceed with your claim if it isnât appropriate to do so, for example because it does not have sufficient prospects of success, or if it is not suitable to be pursued as part of the group claim (for example due to needing to be issued before the rest of the group or where it might involve different parties which are not common to other claimants) â if this is the case, Hausfeld will inform you as soon as possible. As part of the agreement with the litigation funder, your claim will not be filed until the minimum group size of 27,500 claimants has been met and the funder has put in place the insurance policy to cover adverse costs.</p>
          <p>You can cancel your retainer with Hausfeld any time within 14 days of agreeing to the engagement terms. Outside of that 14 day period, you can cancel your retainer at any time but if you do so without Hausfeldâs written permission then you may be charged Hausfeldâs costs, as set out in the engagement letter and any costs incurred on your behalf by the funder as set out below. Hausfeld has the right to cancel their engagement with you if they have a good reason to do so, such as because you have failed to provide all the information required about your claim, and in this scenario you may be charged Hausfeldâs costs insofar as they relate to your claim.</p>
          <p><b>ll. RUNNING THE CLAIMS AS A GROUP â  THE LITIGATON MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT</b></p>
          <p>It would only be viable to bring your claim against Mercedes as part of a group of other claims, given the costs involved in litigation and the efficiencies created by grouping the claims together. It is in your best interests to cooperate with the other claimants represented by Hausfeld. It is also, in Hausfeldâs view, in your best interests to cooperate with a further group of claimants, whose claims are materially similar to the Hausfeld groupâs claims and are being run by another law firm, Harcus Parker. Cooperation with the Harcus Parker claimants maximises the efficiencies and other benefits of bringing the claims as a group.</p>
          <p>In order for multiple claimantsâ claims to be brought as a group, an agreement is needed between claimants as to how to run the claim â  this document in the litigation management agreement. This agreement also, sets out how the committee will run your claim on your behalf, how the costs of running the litigation will be shared, governs the co-operation with the Harcus Parker claimants, how decisions on settlement of the claim will be made by the Committee and how the compensation will be divided between claimants in the event of a successful judgment or settlement.</p>
          <p>The costs of running the litigation will be met by the litigation funder and recovered from Mercedes if the claims are successful. A high proportion of those costs are expected to be common to all of the claims, including the Harcus Parker claimants. However, some costs may be specific to an issue which affects certain claimants or individual to certain claimants. Your allocation of the costs of bringing the claim will be calculated based on the number of vehicles which you have in the claim, as set out in more detail in the litigation management agreement. These costs will be paid on your behalf and recovered from the defendant and you will only have to pay the Funding Fee provided you do not breach any terms of the agreements.</p>
          <p>If damages are obtained via a successful judgment or settlement, the Committee will decide, following the advice of counsel how best to divide up those damages between the claimants. The claimants agree not to accept any settlement offer from Mercedes that does not account for the costs of running the litigation and if any such offer is made and accepted then you will be liable to Hausfeld and to the litigation funder for your costs.</p>
          <p>As with Hausfeldâs engagement, you can terminate your participation in the litigation management agreement within 14 days agreeing to its terms. Outside of this 14 day period, you may only terminate your involvement with the permission of the litigation funder and the insurer and if you do so then you may be liable for your share of the litigation costs. If you do not cooperate with reasonable requests from Hausfeld or the litigation funder during the claim, the committee may discontinue your claim and terminate your participation in the litigation management agreement. Hausfeld will no longer be able to represent you in relation to your claim and  the  Hausfeld  engagement  will  also  be  terminated.  If  your  participation  in  the  litigation  management agreement ends, your engagement with Hausfeld will be terminated and vice versa.</p>
          <p><b>lll. THE COSTS OF THE CLAIMS â  THE FUNDING PARTICIPATION AGREEMEN</b></p>
          <p>The Funding Agreement has been agreed with the Funder by the Chair of the Claimant Committee and in entering into the Funding Participation Agreement, you confirm your agreement to the terms of the Funding Agreement and to the Priorities Agreement.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Funding Agreement sets out the terms on which the Funder will advance the costs of the litigation on your behalf in accordance with the agreed budget and your agreement to pay the Funding Fee (being 40% of your damages and any unrecovered VAT on our Conditional Fees) if the claims are successful.
            </li>
            <li>The Priorities Agreement explains how the claim proceeds will be allocated which sets out the payment to you of the agreed 60% of your damages aware less any unrecovered VAT on our conditional fees.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Funding Agreement provides that the projected costs of running the claims up to a certain limitwill   be paid on  your  behalf  by  the  litigation  funder.  This  includes  any  non-  deferred  fees  paid  under  the  Hausfeld Engagements together with any anticipated disbursement costs and    the   costs of the insurance, which will cover the Hausfeld and the Harcus Parker claimants against the risk of having to pay Mercedesâ costs. The level of funding available under the funding agreement can be increased during the course of the proceedings by agreement between the committee and the funder if we believe it is reasonably necessary to conclude the claims.</p>
          <p>The funding agreement also provides protection to the claimants in the event that their claims are lost. Usually in litigation, the losing party is ordered to pay the winning sideâs legal costs â h owever, in this case, the litigation funder has indemnified you against paying Mercedesâ costs up to Â£7.5 million on the terms of an insurance policy which it will take out. If you do not agree with the terms of the insurance which the funder obtains, including as to the level of indemnity provided under the insurance, then you will have 14 days from the terms of the insurance being made available to you to cancel your participation in the claims.</p>
          <p>There may be some circumstances in   which adverse costs will   not be covered by the insurance policy,  for example where the funder believes it is not viable to continue running the claim and the insurer does not to agree to the claims being discontinued. I t is   also   possible that the insurance may be inadequate in some respect, including due to the level of cover, insurer insolvency or the risk of avoidance, which may    result in exposure to adverse costs.  However, we  believe the  risk of these eventualities is low and in this case any liability for adverse costs would    be split between all   claimants by reference to the number of vehicles for which they claim  such that each claimant is only liable for a share. </p>
          <p>If the   claim is successful, in return for the Funderâs commitment to the claims, you agree to pay the funder the Funding Fee. The Funding Fee comprises 40% of your damages, plus any unrecovered VAT on the portion of legal fees which are contingent upon success, and 100% of all costs which are recovered from the defendants. You will retain 60% of the damages received less any unrecovered VAT on the portion of legal fees which are contingent  upon  success.  The  Funding  Fee  will  be  used  to  pay  the  funder,  Hausfeld  and  counsel  their 
                4 conditional fees, the insurer and the US Consortium (the provider of the claimant platform and associated services).</p>
          <p>As part of the agreement with the litigation funder, your claim will not be filed until the minimum group size of 27,500 claimants has been met and the funder has put in place the insurance.</p>
          <p><u><i>Obligations and warranties:</i></u>As part of   signing up   to   the action, you agree, via    the Funding ParticipationAgreement, that you will   adhere to   the terms of   the funding agreement. The claimants have obligationsunder the funding agreement, in particular:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>that the information provided to Hausfeld about your claim must be true and accurate and that there is nothing of relevance of which you    are aware about your claim which you have failed to disclose to Hausfeld. If any further information about your claim comes to light then you will disclose this to Hausfeld. You also agree that all information which you provide can be shared with the Funder;</li>
            <li>that you have had the opportunity to take independent legal advice in relation to your participation in the claims;</li>
            <li>that you will comply with the terms of the funderâs insurance once this is put in place, a copy of the terms of which will be made available to you. You will also comply with any steps required by the funder to procure, maintain or claim under the insurance and you will not take any steps which may jeopardise the insurance;</li>
            <li>that you   will follow the legal advice of Hausfeld and counsel and cooperate with them throughout the proceedings so as to maximise the chances of a successful outcome and minimise any exposure to having to pay the defendantsâ costs;</li>
            <li>that you   agree that if you do not comply with your obligations under the Funding Agreement or if any of the warranties that you have provided are untrue, you may be in breach of the Funding Agreement and liable to pay the Funder your share of the costs the Funder has invested in the claims. You may also share liability for any breach by the claimant committee; and</li>
            <li>to follow legal advice and to abide by the terms of the funderâs insurance, and it is important that you follow these obligations and comply with any requests from Hausfeld or the Committee or else you may be in breach of the funding agreement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><u><i>Termination:</i></u>The funder can    terminate your participation in the funding agreement if  you breach its  terms or   fail    to   co-  operate with    any    request from Hausfeld or   the Committee to   progress the claims where requested to   do   so. In   this    scenario you will   be liable to   pay t he Funder your share of   the costs the Funderhas    invested in the claims. The funder may    also  terminate its  funding of   the claims if  the size  of   the claimant group does not    reach the target of   43,200 claimants, if  the claims become commercially unviable or   the prospects of   success drop below a   certain level and/or the Funder cannot obtain the insurance on terms which align with    the Priorities Agreement. If  the claims have been filed    and    the funder stops funding the claims because the claimant targets are not    met,    the funder will   cover any    exposure you have to Mercedes for    paying Mercedesâ costs. However, if  the funder stops funding the claims for    any    otherreason and    the insurer does not    approve of the discontinuance of   the claims, you may    be exposed to paying to   Mercedes your share of   their costs. If  you wish    to   withdraw from the claim, you can    only do   so with    the agreement of   the Funder and    you will   be liable to   pay the Funder your share of   the costs the Funder has    invested in the claim.</p>
          <p>Funding Agreement and the Priorities Agreement including any increase to the budget, but it may only agree to change the amount of the Funding Fee in circumstances in which it is not otherwise be possible to put in place the insurance and is considered by the Claimant Committee in the claimantsâ best interests in order to 
                5 progress the claims. You understand that if the Committee proposes to change the amount of the Funding Fee, you will have the right within 14 days of notice to elect to cancel your participation in the Funding Agreement, the Priorities Agreement and the claims.</p>
          <p><b><u>THIS IS ONLY A SUMMARY</u></b> it is not a substitute for    reading the agreements in full.    You    must now read each agreement and    sign to   say that you agree with    its  terms. You    may    wish    to   take    independent legal advice on   the agreements before entering into   them. As set    out    in the agreements, if  you are signing up as a    consumer rather than a  business then you have a right to   cancel your participation in the agreementswithin 14   days by sending written notice to   MercedesEmissionsClaim@hausfeld.com.</p>
