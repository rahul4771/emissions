                       <p>These terms and conditions (“Terms”) apply to all services provided by Carwood Accountancy Limited (trading as “Tax Allowance Awareness”) a limited company registered in England and Wales under company number 10782318 at Express Networks 3, 6 Oldham Road, Manchester, M4 5DE (also refereed to in these terms as “Carwood Accountancy”, “we”, “us” or “our”).</p> 

                      <h4><b>Services</b></h4>

                      <p>We will prepare the documentation needed in order to apply for the transfer of the Marriage Allowance from one person to another, and endeavour to create a tax rebate on your behalf.</p>

                      <p>We will apply for the Marriage Allowance to be transferred for all eligible tax years that have passed.  For future tax years we will automatically apply each year for the Marriage Allowance to be transferred until you advise us that you no longer wish us to act on your behalf.</p>

                      <h4><b>Obligations of Carwood Accountancy</b></h4>

                      <p>We will undertake to process all information provided and verified by you, your spouse or civil partner in order to allocate any unused Marriage Allowance from one party to another.</p>

                      <p>We will not undertake an audit or obtain third party verification of any information provided to us.  It is your responsibility and that of your spouse or civil partner to ensure that all information and declarations provided to Carwood Accountancy are true, accurate and correct.  You must remember that HMRC will hold you wholly responsible and liable for any incorrect information provided.</p>

                      <p>At Carwood Accountancy we are proud of our reputation with HMRC and other parties.  In order to maintain our reputation we reserve the right to stop acting for you at anytime if, in our opinion, continuing to act for you may jeopardise this reputation.  If we decided to cease acting we will not charge a fee for any services undertaken.</p>

                      <h4><b>Obligations of you</b></h4>

                      <p>It is your obligation and that of your spouse or civil partner to disclose to Carwood Accountancy all of your earnings, income or gains for each of the tax years that a Marriage Allowance transfer is being applied for together with any debts owing to HMRC.  Carwood Accountancy cannot know what any earnings, income or gains have been and will not be held liable for any incorrect information provided.</p>

                      <p>You, your spouse or civil partner agree to co-operate fully with Carwood Accountancy at all times and provide any and all information that we reasonably require.</p>

                      <p>You, your spouse or civil partner will be responsible for the repayment of any tax refund received from HMRC where it is found that the information provided in order to secure a repayment is found by HMRC to be incorrect.  In this case, Carwood Accountancy will still be entitled to a fee for the services that it has provided.</p>

                      <h4><b>Tax Rebate and Fees</b></h4>

                      <p>By signing the Declaration to Act and our Letter of Assignment, in favour of Carwood Accountancy, you unconditionally and irrevocably instruct HMRC to release, assign and repay to Carwood Accountancy any tax rebate arising.</p>

                      <p>Where any tax rebate is sent directly to you by HMRC without the explicit approval or authority of Carwood Accountancy, or your tax code is changed by HMRC in place of issuing the rebate, you agree to pay to us our agreed fee within 7 days.  We reserve the right to undertake all legal means for recovery of our fee where you fail to make payment to us within 7 days of receipt of the rebate or the change to your tax code.</p>  

                      <p>Our fee will be 35 percent of any tax rebate obtained from HMRC, regardless of what it relates to, plus VAT.  VAT will be applied to our fee at the prevailing rate.</p>

                      <p>You agree and acknowledge that our fee, including VAT, will be retained from the rebate that we receive from HMRC and the difference will be repaid to you by cheque.  The cheque will be made payable to the person who has generated the rebate and posted to the address entered when completing the application process.</p>

                      <p>If after 6 months the cheque remains uncashed, we will cancel the cheque and be entitled to retain all of the monies received from HMRC.</p>

                      <p>Should you require a further cheque to be issued we will be entitled to charge a fee of £15 plus VAT.</p>

                      <p>If any of the tax rebate obtained is used by HMRC to meet any other tax liability that you may have, our fee will be based on the amount of the tax rebate generated not the amount actually repaid and received by us.</p> 

                      <p>If you have applied for the Marriage Allowance transfer (either directly or via another business) and HMRC issue a rebate to us as a result of the claim we have made on your behalf, we will still be entitled to charge a fee for the work that we have undertaken.  The fee will be 35 percent of any rebate obtained plus VAT at the prevailing rate.</p>

                      <h4><b>Limitation of Liability</b></h4>

                      <p>The services that we undertake for you, your spouse or civil partner are limited to the transfer of the Marriage Allowance.</p>   

                      <p>We shall not be liable to you, your spouse or civil partner whether in contract, tort, breach of statutory duties, misrepresentation or otherwise for any loss or damages which maybe suffered or incurred.</p>

                      <p>Our total liability to you, your spouse or civil partner shall be limited to five times the fee payable for the services that we have agreed to undertake.  By agreeing to us acting on your behalf, you, your spouse or civil partner agree to this limitation and you should consider the fairness of this limit before entering into this agreement.</p>
